# QualityAssurance
In this project, We want to predict whether microchips from a fabrication plant passes quality assurance (QA). During QA, each microchip goes through various tests to ensure it is functioning correctly. We have two test results, based on which we have trained our model and on the basis of these test results, we predict whether the microchips should be accepted or rejected.
